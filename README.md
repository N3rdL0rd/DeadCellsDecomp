# Dead Cells Decompilation Project

This project is a work in progress (WIP) that aims to decompile v35 (`50edff4`) of the PC version of Dead Cells back to its original Haxe sources.

## Status

The project is currently in the early stages of development. If you are interested in contributing, please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

## What this project is (and isn't)

This project is:

- An attempt to decompile Dead Cells and its related libraries and modules.
- A resource for modders and speedrunners who want to extend the game's functionality or gain insights into how it works.
- (Eventually) a fully matching decompilation that can be used to build a working version of the game.

This project is not:

- A platform for illegal activities. Decompiling is done for educational purposes and we do not endorse or support any form of illegal activities related to game hacking or piracy.
- A finished product. This is a work in progress and there may be incomplete or inaccurate information.
- A modding platform or modloader. This project is focused on decompiling the game, not on creating mods or modding tools. However, we hope that this project will enable modders to create new and exciting mods for the game.

## Structure

The project is divided into several main components:

- `deadcells` - Main source tree
- `utils` - Utility scripts and tools for decompilation and analysis.
- `docs` - Documentation and guides for contributors and users.

## Future Plans

- Examine mobile and console versions of the game to see if they can be decompiled.
